# Patient-Data-Model
The Grey-Sloane Memorial Hospital has a need to provide its patients with an online patient intake form to support the patient’s information and to make it easily accessible and understandable. This system is to be a replacement for the older paper systems that have been produced in the past.

System Overview and Diagram
	
•	The database can be mainly categorized into providers and patient information.
•	The accessibility of data for the Hospital/Provider becomes easier as the form is now filled online and the patient himself fills it and acknowledges what he has filled.


System Configuration:
It can work on 32/64 bit windows operating system from Microsoft.
